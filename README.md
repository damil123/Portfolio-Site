##  Design

### Fonts  
- Headings (h1, h2, h3) ,  Georgia, serif  for a formal look
- Body text  Arial, sans-serif so itseasy to read

### Colour Palette  
- **Dark Green (#013220)** 
- **Lighter Green (#025f3d)** 
- **Beige (#f5f5dc)**  
- **Yellow Accent (#e6c200)**

This palette was chosen to give a  warm aesthetic while still ensuring accessibility and contrast.  

### Layout & Widths  
- **Base container** : 90% width with a max-width: 1100px  
- **Mobile (≤480px)** : stacked layout, smaller text.

- **Laptop (769px+)** : full layout with larger text and centered content.  
- **Footer** : fixed to the bottom  

### Borders  
A card-style border was added around projects and media (photo/video)
